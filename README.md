# Password-Generator

## Random Password Generator
I have used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to program the functional behavior of this website to generate a random password after gathering user inputs through a series of prompts for password preferences. 
Specific criteria for the password include having a length of 10-64 characters, lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters, each prompt is validated after selecting options, and the generated password that matches the selected criteria will be displayed on the page textbox.
